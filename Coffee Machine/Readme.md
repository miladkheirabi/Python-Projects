# ☕ Coffee Machine (OOP in Python)

A simple **Object-Oriented Programming** project in Python that simulates a coffee machine.  
It allows the user to order drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino), check resources, and process payments using virtual coins.

## 📂 Project Structure
coffee_machine/  
│  
├── main.py           # Main program loop  
├── menu.py           # Menu and MenuItem classes  
├── coffee_maker.py   # CoffeeMaker class (handles resources)  
├── money_machine.py  # MoneyMachine class (handles coins and payment)  
└── README.md         # Project documentation  

## 🚀 Features
- **Object-Oriented Design** — code organized into separate classes and files.  
- Menu system with multiple drink options.  
- Resource management for water, milk, and coffee.  
- Payment processing with coins (quarters, dimes, nickles, pennies).  
- Change calculation and insufficient funds handling.  
- Resource report functionality.  

## 🛠 How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
Clone the repository and run:
